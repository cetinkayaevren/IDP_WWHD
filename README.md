## Getting started.
### In order to establish the pipeline, please do the following steps:
#### 1) create a venv using the requirements.txt file we have addded.
#### 2) please dowload the data from " https://zenodo.org/records/5092309 " the compressed file should be opened inside the data(2021) directory/folder. 
#### After applying the steps mentioned above, pipeline should execute without any errors. just press 'run all' on the notebook. the resulting files should be small in size, and can be uploaded to git or send via email for evaluation, also it is a totally realistic possibility to create a evaluation pipeline for the result evaluation.
